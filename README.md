###Description
GreaterOutdoors is a two week individual project solving the issue of staying motivated while playing outdoors. It allows users to receive customized playlists based on physical activity and time. Then, add playlists directly to your Spotify account!

###How it Works
Grabs randomized song from current userâ€™s Spotify account to create taste for new playlist. Then, asks user for activity and intensity, as well as duration. Once those are entered, the app creates a playlist based on the user's taste that's long enough for the activity plus a few skips. Finally, the user can add any playlist in their list of playlists to Spotify and listen instantly.
